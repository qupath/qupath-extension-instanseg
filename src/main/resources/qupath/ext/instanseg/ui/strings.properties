# PyTorch Download Window
ui.pytorch-downloading = Downloading PyTorch engine...
ui.pytorch = PyTorch engine not found - would you like to download it?\n This may take some time (but is only required once).
ui.pytorch-popup = No segmentation performed - PyTorch engine not found.

# Stop Tasks Window
ui.stop-tasks = Stop all running tasks?

## Errors
error.window = Error initializing InstanSeg window.\nAn internet connection is required when running for the first time.
error.no-imagedata = Cannot run InstanSeg without ImageData.
error.downloading = Error downloading files
error.localModel = Can't find file in user model directory
error.tiles-failed = %d tiles failed. This is often a memory issue.\nConsider decreasing tile size or the number of threads used.
